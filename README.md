# React Markdown Previwer

A simple Markdown Previwer built as a React project. The page takes user input in a text box and displays the output in Markdown format. A simple way to solidify core concepts in React around setting and changing state, event handling, controlled compoenents, and updating values on the screen as a result of changes in state.

Boilerplate setup using Facebook's create-react-app.
